The research article by Ezgi Avcı presents a No-Code Automated Machine Learning (Auto-ML) platform specifically designed for the energy sector, addressing the challenges of integrating machine learning (ML) within diverse data environments. This innovative platform automates essential steps in the ML pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning, while incorporating domain-specific knowledge to effectively manage issues such as fluctuating energy demands and regulatory compliance.

The platform's modular architecture allows for customization and scalability, making it suitable for various energy sub-sectors, including renewable energy, oil and gas, and power distribution. Preliminary findings suggest that the platform significantly enhances data processing efficiency and predictive accuracy, thereby democratizing access to advanced analytical capabilities for non-expert users.

The article details the platform's architecture, featuring entity-relationship diagrams and data lake designs that support robust data management and integration from multiple asynchronous systems. It underscores the importance of high-quality datasets in ML, addressing challenges in data searching and synthesis, and highlights effective data cleaning methods, including crowdsourcing and automated systems. Data augmentation is emphasized as a vital aspect of data preparation, aimed at generating new data and preventing model overfitting.

Feature engineering is identified as crucial for maximizing the utility of raw data, involving processes such as feature selection, construction, and extraction, all of which are automated by the platform to enhance efficiency. The model generation and evaluation process within AutoML is also automated, simplifying the traditionally complex task of selecting and configuring ML algorithms. The article discusses various algorithm types, including Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks, and their specific applications in classification and regression tasks.

The model selection process in AutoML is outlined, with a focus on ensemble methods like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Machines to improve predictive accuracy and reduce overfitting. Systematic exploration strategies, such as grid search and Bayesian optimization, are discussed for identifying optimal model parameters, alongside key performance metrics that ensure model selection aligns with business objectives.

The document reviews several popular Auto-ML tools, including Auto-sklearn, Auto-Keras, TPOT, Auto-WEKA, H2O, and Amazon SageMaker, which aim to simplify the machine learning process. Notably, advancements in AutoGluon are highlighted for their ability to automate data preprocessing and model exploration, enhancing model performance through multi-layer stacking and ensemble strategies.

Despite the platform's potential, challenges persist in implementing Auto-ML in the energy sector, particularly concerning data quality and the black-box nature of Auto-ML systems, which can undermine user trust. The proposed platform seeks to address these issues by focusing on streaming data analytics, scalability, and stringent data quality management.

Additionally, the document outlines a machine learning approach designed for Utility Users, emphasizing user-friendly interfaces for data viewing, addition, and preprocessing. These interfaces facilitate efficient data management, enabling non-experts to perform complex tasks with ease. The model training interface allows users to select and configure ML models while incorporating advanced visualization tools to enhance model interpretability.

Preliminary results from pilot projects indicate that the platform effectively improves energy demand forecasting accuracy and overall operational efficiency. Future research directions include exploring collaborative learning approaches to enhance model robustness while maintaining data privacy and adapting the platform for other industries, such as healthcare and finance.
